I'm a computer scientist student at CSUF and I expect to graduate at the year 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5 Part-1
  
  This is my favorite lab due to the usefulness that I can see in the code. The program being able to convert the feet into inches and other forms of measurements to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle is impressive. It’s due to the grounded realism that this could be a tool that helps people in the workforce and in the day to day that makes it one of my favorites.
  
* Lab 6 Part-2
  
  This lab is one of my favorites as the usage of turning a game that I’m familiar with into a program. I was already acquainted with the rules of blackjack as well as playing it often in family gatherings, and being able to reiterate the rules and gameplay through code was fun. So to be able to turn a card game that has been a part of my life into code and a functioning program was very intriguing.
  
* Lab 8 Part-1
  
  This lab is one of my favorites because during this time the Olympics was going crazy on the internet. This led me down a deep rabbit hole as I was constantly watching past olympic contests, and with the programming, it helped me understand the points system and how it all works. Not only that, but the practicality of olympic tournaments being able to be scored with this kind of programming shows the efficiency of computer science in general.
